# Interactive Text Classification System  
### TF-IDF Vectorization with Multinomial Naive Bayes (Streamlit)

## 📌 Project Overview
        This project implements an interactive text classification system using 
        TF-IDF feature extraction and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

The system classifies text into three categories:
      - Physical
      - Educational
      - Spiritual

A Streamlit interface is used to demonstrate each step of the machine learning pipeline.


## 🎯 Objectives
          - Prepare a labeled text dataset
          - Perform text preprocessing and normalization
          - Extract features using TF-IDF
          - Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
          - Predict categories for unseen text
          - Evaluate model performance
          - Present results and analysis interactively


## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline
         The project follows a structured ML workflow:

             1. Dataset Preparation  
             2. Text Preprocessing  
             3. TF-IDF Vectorization  
             4. Model Training (Naive Bayes)  
             5. Prediction with Confidence Scores  
             6. Model Evaluation  
             7. Results & Analysis  
             8. Full Pipeline Execution

         Each step is implemented and visualized separately in Streamlit.

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Small, manually created dataset
- Evaluation performed on training data
- TF-IDF does not capture semantic similarity between words

These limitations are acknowledged as part of the learning objective.
